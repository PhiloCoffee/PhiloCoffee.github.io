🎬 PhiloCoffee Movie Night - Let's Dive into Philosophy on Screen!

Dear Esteemed PhiloCoffee Members,

I hope this message finds you all well and excited about our upcoming coffeeshop tour! To keep the philosophical momentum going, we are thrilled to announce another thought-provoking activity - a Movie Night during our vacation, tentatively scheduled for October 6th.

We aim to select a film that not only entertains but also stimulates philosophical discussion and deep reflection. As discussed before, this time we chose the **Tenet**, a mind-bending sci-fi thriller by Christopher Nolan, where a protagonist navigates international espionage using time inversion to prevent global catastrophe.

Your input is invaluable, and we encourage those interested to reply to this email with your preferences and any additional suggestions. Based on your responses, we will finalize the film selection and further details.

Looking forward to a night of cinematic philosophy and lively discussions!

Warm Regards,

Tony Wang
President, PhiloCoffee Club
