## 个人简评
这本书是我创社的intuition， 大概讲的是三个大学朋友，不同专业不同爱好，课余时间聚在咖啡馆讨论哲学的书

对话体的科普文，深度不会特别深，但是很适合入门和启发思考。因为里面有非常多有趣的问题和适当（符合大学生水平）的解读

一两年前读的了，今天突然想起来为什么想办社团，也启发我向大家征稿。一起交流有趣的书籍

Does God really exist? Can the mind and body be separated? Is the world predetermined or full of possibilities? Is private property truly sacred and inviolable? Can true democracy be achieved under wealth inequality? What gives me the right to be myself? This book presents ideas, arguments, rebuttals, critiques, questions, and answers in the history of Western philosophy through the passionate debates of three college students, revolving around these eternal questions.

## Personal Review
This book is the intuition behind the founding of my club. It roughly tells the story of three college friends with different majors and interests, who discuss philosophy in their spare time at a coffee shop.

It's a dialogical piece of popular science writing, not particularly deep but very suitable for beginners and for inspiring thought. It has a lot of interesting questions and appropriate interpretations that are up to a college student's level.

I read this book one or two years ago, and suddenly remembered today why I wanted to start a club. It also inspired me to call for submissions. Let's share interesting books together.
