Hi folks,

Dear Club Member,

 Wishing you a thrive in your midterms!

Tomorrow afternoon, We are organizing a coffeeshop tour for an aromatic blend of conversation and coffee. We gonna visit

 **- Date & Time**: November 16th, 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM
 **- Location: ALLIN-Hengtou Street (

**- Transportation:** The coffeeshop locates beside the East Mountain, which means we may need to take the taxi to reach there together. 
 **- Rally point:** **RC1 Lobby at 4:20 PM.**

As fans of coffee culture, we stand at the precipice of the Third Wave of Coffee â€” a revolution that prizes quality, sustainability, and the unique character of regional coffee varieties. This movement has elevated coffee from a mere commodity to a craft, with each cup offering a window into the diverse narratives of flavor from around the globe.

Our visit to ALL-IN Cafe is more than just a tasting; it's a casual COFFEE101. Here, we will explore why specialty coffee commands a higher price, justified by its unparalleled quality and the meticulous care that goes into its production. From plant to cup, each bean's journey is a testament to the passionate individuals dedicated to bringing us these exceptional brews.

At ALL-IN, you can taste many different beans, each with its distinct profile. You'll experience how the Third Wave's embrace of direct trade and artisanal methods has enriched our coffee experience. This can be reflected on the pour-over, ice drip and many other new technique and idea on the brewing. 

Your participation will add a unique essence to our collective appreciation of coffee culture.

Warm regards,

Tony Wang President, PhiloCoffee Club
